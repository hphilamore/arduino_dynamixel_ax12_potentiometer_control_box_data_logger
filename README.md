Robot Tentacle Control Instructions 

1.	Turn on by connecting to mains power
2.	The motors will take approx. 10 seconds to initialise - once this setup is completed, the green LEDs on the sliders will come on. 
(If during this time the green LEDs flash 5 times, the SD card is not connected/setup correctly and logging will not take place. Fix the problem then press the reset button on the Arduino to restart.)
3.	Control the robot tentacle by moving the sliders
4.	To record the motor angles during operation, press the blue button. The light on the button will come on to indicate logging has started.
(If no light comes on, there is a problem with the SD card.) 
5.	To stop recording press the blue button again. 
It is important to stop any recordings before powering off the system to avoid corrupting the SD card and losing data!
